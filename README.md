# Sudoku-Solver
Sudoku is a combinatorial, logic-based, number-placement puzzle. In classic Sudoku, the objective is to fill a 9 × 9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3 × 3 sub-grids that compose the grid contain all of the digits from 1 to 9. The puzzle setter provides a partially completed grid, which for a well-posed puzzle has a single solution

My task is to implement in Python the following constraint satisfaction problem algorithms:
Brute force (exhaustive) search algorithm,
Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) back-tracking search,
CSP with forward-checking and MRV heuristics

and apply them to solve the puzzle (provided in a CSV file).
